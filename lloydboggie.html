		<h1>Innovation and Experience Design</h1>

		<div class="entry">
			<p>
			We are world-class innovators, working at the cutting edge of emerging technological capabilities to design and build new interactions and experiences. Together, we have co-led The New York Times R&amp;D Lab, guiding the lab to international renown for creating experiences and ideas that shape the future of media. We developed a multi-faceted research agenda to explore technological and social changes that will impact the media landscape, led a team of creative technologists in designing and building new kinds of interactive experiences, and collaborated across the organization to influence strategic decision-making.
			</p>

			<p>
			Both of us have written and spoken extensively about our work, in publications and at conferences across multiple disciplines, including design, technology, media, and corporate innovation. We are adept at working across disciplines, and our approach combines user experience design, technical experimentation, and product strategy in an integrated, holistic way that is essential to any modern organization.
			</p>

			<p>
			In contexts from large, established organizations to startups to academic and cultural institutions, our skills can be applied to a variety of endeavors, including: 
			<ul>
				<li>Leading product design and strategy</li>
				<li>Designing compelling user experiences that utilize new technologies and interactions</li>
				<li>Performing applied research to envision, understand, and communicate the future of your industry</li>
				<li>Creating innovation capabilities for organizations large and small</li>
			</ul>
