            <h1>Obamacare Cracks Down, Sort Of</h1>
            <p>
              One reason insurers don’t think Obamacare is stable: <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/01/20/after-insurer-complaints-small-steps-to-toughen-special-enrollment-period-eligibility/">too easy</a> for people to sign up outside of the regular enrollment seasons (so they may not sign up until they’re sick). On Tuesday, the Obama administration <a href="https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/FAQ-Regarding-Verification-of-SEPs.pdf">announced</a> that it’s going to try something new: verifying that people who sign up outside of regular enrollment are actually eligible to do it.
            </p><p>
              <strong>What It Means</strong>: The whole point of Obamacare’s open enrollment periods &mdash; just like companies have for their workers &mdash; is to make sure people don’t wait until they need health care to get insurance. The new step might make sure open enrollment actually means something, but it’s late in the game. (And it’s just a pilot program &mdash; it’s not even happening everywhere.)
            </p>

            <a href="#" class="more" id="keepreading">Keep reading (474 words) &#8964;</a>

            <!--start hidden more text-->
            <div id="more-text">
              <p>
              In a <a href="https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/FAQ-Regarding-Verification-of-SEPs.pdf">"Frequently Asked Questions"</a> posting about special enrollments, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it will create a pilot program to see what happens if people have to prove they’re eligible before they can sign up.
              </p><p>
              Why a pilot program? Why don’t they just change the rules and do it? Because CMS wants to find out how the change would affect things like total enrollment in Obamacare &mdash; which is already lower than projected &mdash; and, importantly, the "risk pool."
              </p><p>
              That’s the term for the mix of healthy and sick people insurers are covering in their Obamacare plans. If they don’t get the right mix of people &mdash; not enough healthy people to cover the costs of the sick &mdash; the insurance plans won’t be stable, and more insurers could pull out of the market.
              </p><p>
              Keep in mind that two major insurers &mdash; Aetna and UnitedHealth &mdash; have already said they’re going to stop selling health insurance in the Obamacare marketplaces, claiming their costs have been higher than they expected. That’s already going to cut the amount of competition and choices for Obamacare customers. The health consulting firm Avalere estimates that <a href="http://avalere.com/expertise/life-sciences/insights/experts-predict-sharp-decline-in-competition-across-the-aca-exchanges">one third of the country</a> might have no competition in the Obamacare markets next year.
              </p><p>
              And since the whole point of those marketplaces was to have choice and competition &mdash; President Obama <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-obamas-health-care-speech/">compared it</a> to the menu of health care choices members of Congress get &mdash; the program can’t afford to lose more insurers.

              </p><p>
              <strong>What to Watch</strong>: Up until now, the big problem with the risk pool &mdash; at least according to health insurers &mdash; is that it has been too easy for people to drop in and out of health coverage, not too hard. When they do that, according to the insurers, they wait until they’re sick and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/us/politics/insurers-say-costs-are-climbing-as-more-enroll-past-health-act-deadline.html?_r=0">drive up costs</a> for everyone.
              </p><p>
              But if it’s the healthy people &mdash; not the sick people &mdash; who don’t sign up when they have to prove they’re eligible, the insurance plans could become less stable, not more. Last year, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2015-Fact-sheets-items/2015-08-13.html">CMS found</a>, the people who did the special sign-ups were actually younger than the ones who enrolled during the regular season.
              </p><p>
              And as law professor and Obamacare expert Timothy Jost <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2016/09/06/cms-sees-drop-in-special-enrollment-period-selections-plans-further-steps/">points out</a> at the Health Affairs blog, healthy people "may well decide to forego coverage rather than go through the hassle of the confirmation process."
              </p><p>
              So watch to see what happens when the pilot gets underway. All CMS is saying, for now, is that it will be sometime next year.
